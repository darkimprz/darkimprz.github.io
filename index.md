Many people know that I'm a rower but not many know that I started rowing because I wanted to row an ocean. You could say I've never had a hard time with dreaming big. 

Seven years later and I fulfilled a dream of mine. It took 49 days 23 hours 15 minutes and everyone in my life investing their time to make crossing the Pacific Ocean by human power happen.
