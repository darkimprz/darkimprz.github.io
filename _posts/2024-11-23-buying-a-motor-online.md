title: "Buying a motor online"
---

This was a hard process. Much harder than I expected and is series of big gambles.

online store fronts don’t have in stock the motors they post online. Those motors for the most part are representative of what they carry. I’m not sure what would happen if you just picked one and tossed it in your shopping cart. 
in my situation, when I emailed many different vendors they never responded or generally weren’t helpful to find or buy anything. I hate calling people but that’s what it took to start finding anything in stock.
