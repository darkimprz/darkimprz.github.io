title: "Oil Analysis"
---

Took a sample of oil today from the sti motor and sending it off for analysis. I’m curious about its life prior to now. Also would like to know about any really bad things (bearing material in oil, etc.) before putting it in the RS. The oil didn’t look bad when it came out but it was used and smelled old. It also had a no name filter on it.

Interesting to me was learning about the coolant lines connected to the oiler cooler. That’s the black line above the exhaust going to the silver cooler under the worn off sticker. It uses a combination of hard lines and hoses to flow coolant to the oil cooler. The hardline will be added to a list of parts waiting to be refurbished.

Side note - I sprayed PBlaster on the heat shielding bolts as I’d like to remove and clean the entire motor up before installing it.
