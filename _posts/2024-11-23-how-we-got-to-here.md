The RS has a head gasket failure and finally I have a garage where I can work on it myself.

I’d like the RS to be my drive it because you feel like it but not because you have to car. To me this means not using it as a daily driver but I can daily it, if I want to. I’d like to do a yearly road trip in it and a yearly autox/hpde.
