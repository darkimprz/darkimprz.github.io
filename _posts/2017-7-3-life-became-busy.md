It's been a few weeks but i'm still riding high off the thrill of clicking the button to enter the 2018 Great Pacific Race. There's so much to do and only 47 weeks to go.. I've been looking forward to setting off on this journey for longer than I can really remember. 

I started rowing in 2012 with the ultimate dream of rowing an ocean. Not knowing how to accomplish that, I decided to learn how to row at the local rowing club [(Hampton Roads Rowing Club)](http://www.hrrc.net/). Since then it's been a whirl wind of growing up, expanding my limits and keeping my eyes open for the next lesson to learn. I have a feeling there will be combination of all three in the coming year and few months. Stay tuned, lots more coming soon.
